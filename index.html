            <p class="section-text">I'm a Korean who grew up in Hong Kong that is now studying in the United States. This has allowed me to experience multiple varying cultures and helps me adapt to many foreign scenarios.</p>
            <p class="section-text">I love identifying and delving deep into problems that I'm passionate about through code. For example, I want people to be able to spend their time meaningfully if possible. Because of this, I created a more optimized course search for fellow BU students.</p>
            <p class="section-text">I believe that resumes don't say enough about a given person, and I hope this website can tell you more about who I am not only as a programmer but also as a person.</p>

            <p class="section-text">Tools Utilized: 3js, GSAP, Vite, Blender</p>
            <p class="section-text">Inspired by Boko33's portfolio website, I decided to make my own room in Hong Kong as I'll be moving from a room I lived in for 13 years. This was good opportunity to not only learn something new but also create a personal record of where I grew up. All assets were designed by scratch.</p>
            <h3 class="section-heading bpi"><a href="https://dev-bpi.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Boston Police Index: Feb 2023-May 2023</a></h3>
            <p class="section-text">Tools Utilized: TypeScript React, Taiga, Scrum Cycle, PostgresSQL</p>
            <p class="section-text">Police discrimination is a serious issue that affects everywhere in the United States. A site called Woke Windows provided information about officers and their activites in Boston. This was so that lawyers and advocates could easily access data that could show that certain officers were treating a group of people in a certain way. It has since been shut down, and BU was asked to create a replacement. As part of the core infrastructure team, we were tasked with building the backbone of the site and communicating to all other groups about the type of data they could give us and what we, as the CI team, had to accomodate for said type of data by adapting reuseable components. With the given data, we were also tasked with moving it to the database. The site keeps track of all recent boston police activites.</p>
            <h3 class="section-heading courseSearch"><a href="https://bucoursesearch.web.app/" target="_blank">BU Course Search 2.0: Dec 2022-Jan 2023</a></h3>
            <p class="section-text">Tools Utilized: Firebase, React, WebScraping, API</p>
            <p class="section-text">BU's official course search has many unintuitive downsides. It requires constant opening of new tabs, lacking proper quality of life filters, and no review/difficulty tracker for the school. Rather than waiting for the website to get better, I decided to make a better version myself. I scraped the entire course search database, and uploaded it to a seperate firebase database to enable better filters.</p>
            <h3 class="section-heading artGuessr"><a href="https://artguessr.art/" target="_blank">ArtGuessr: Dec 2022-Jan 2023</a></h3>
            <p class="section-text">Tools Utilized: Firebase, Google OAuth, Decoupled Architecture, API</p>
            <p class="section-text">Inspired by GeoGuessr, me and three others created a website. We practiced making API calls, decoupling the frontend and backend, and implementing login authentication. The website would display a artwork grabbed from a mueseum API and the user can choose where the artpiece originates from. User's accuracy is tracked by using their google accounts.</p>
