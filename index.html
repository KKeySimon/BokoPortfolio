              Hi! My name is Simon Kye. I'm a computer scientist studying in
              Boston Unviersity completing the MS portion of my BA/MS dual
              degree. (The BA portion has been finished and I'm able to get my
              bachelor's at any point)
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
              I'm a Korean who grew up in Hong Kong that is now studying in the
              United States. This has allowed me to experience multiple varying
              cultures and helps me adapt to many foreign scenarios.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
              I love questioning the status quo and constantly asking if
              something is good enough. For example, I knew my school's course
              search could be optimized in many ways and decided to make a
              optimized course search for fellow BU students.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
              What motivates me is simply being able to see the impact and the
              scope of problems I can solve through programming, something I
              used to do for fun as a kid. I've worked on allowing easier access
              to criminal justice data to help under-represented groups have a
              fairer trial. I've helped missing people be identified easier and
              faster through the use of machine learning. I'm excited to see
              what else I can contribute to with the skills that I have.

              room in Hong Kong as I'll be moving from a room I lived in for 13
              years. This was good opportunity to not only learn something new

              A site called Woke Windows provided information about officers and
              their activites in Boston. This was so that lawyers and advocates
              could easily access data that could show that certain officers
              were treating a group of people in a certain way. It has since
              been shut down, and BU was asked to create a replacement. As part
              of the core infrastructure team, we were tasked with building the
              backbone of the site and communicating to all other groups, which
              were in charge of data collection, about the type of data they
              could give us to create proper reuseable components. With the
              given data, we were also tasked with moving it to the database.
              The site keeps track of all recent boston police activites.

              BU's official course search has many unintuitive downsides. It
              requires constant opening of new tabs, lacking proper quality of
              life filters, and no review/difficulty tracker for the school.
              Rather than waiting for the website to get better, I decided to
              make a better version myself. I scraped the entire course search
              database, and uploaded it to a seperate firebase database to
              enable better filters. This database is automatically updated
              every 24/7 hours with the use of AWS lambda functions.<br />BU
              Course Search has since replaced and updated their course search
              and the site now shows legacy data.

              Inspired by GeoGuessr, me and three others created a website. We
              practiced making API calls, decoupling the frontend and backend,
              and implementing login authentication. The website would display a
              artwork grabbed from a mueseum API and the user can choose where
              the artpiece originates from. User's accuracy is tracked by using
              their google accounts.<br />Google's OAuth changes has since
              broken the site.
